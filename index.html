		<p>I'm currently a sophomore at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
		   studying Computer Science and Management, trying to make my
		   way into the weird and wonderful world of Software.</p>

		<p>This site will act as my 'home base' for all my projects and thoughts
	           on a variety of topics.</p>
