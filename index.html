            <h2>introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my (very bare) homepage!</p>
            <p>This is where I'll be keeping projects I do, thoughts I have, or really anything else I can imagine. It will
                all be organized though, so it won't be hard to find what you're looking for.</p>
            <p>At the moment updates to the site will be infrequent at best, but I'll try my best to keep things going.</p>
            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>I'm John Farrell, a Computer Science and Business Management dual major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
                I keep myself pretty busy with school, but when I'm not behind a screen I like to be in the gym, out in nature,
                or under my car.</p>
            <p>I am currently involved in a research project to gather social media usage information on entrepreneurs and startups
                to see what works and what doesn't when it comes to success and social media. You can read more about the
                project and what I've done for it
                <a href="">here</a>.</p>
